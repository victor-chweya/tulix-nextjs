              <h5>3.Description of Service</h5>
              <p>
                Tulix is a person-to-business (P2B) payments platform,
                facilitating payments by individuals both abroad and locally for
                purchase of retail goods and services offered by businesses
                located in Kenya. Pursuant to this, Tulix has partnered with an
                existing and reputable digital Remittance Service Provider
                (RSP), Stripe, to ensure secure transmission of funds.
              </p>
              <h5>4.Purchases</h5>
              <p>
                If you wish to purchase any product or service made available
                through Service (“<strong>Purchase</strong>”), you may be asked
                to supply certain information relevant to your Purchase
                including, without limitation, your credit card number, the
                expiration date of your credit card, your billing address, and
                your shipping information.
              </p>
              <p>
                You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to
                use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection
                with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to
                us is true, correct and complete.
              </p>
              <p>
                We reserve the right to refuse or cancel your order at any time
                for reasons including but not limited to: product or service
                availability, errors in the description or price of the product
                or service, error in your order or other reasons.
              </p>
              <h5>5.Contests, Sweepstakes and Promotions</h5>
              <p>
                Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “
                <strong>Promotions</strong>”) made available through Service may
                be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms of
                Service. If you participate in any Promotions, please review the
                applicable rules as well as our Privacy Policy. If the rules for
                a Promotion conflict with these Terms of Service, Promotion
                rules will apply.
              </p>
              <h5>6.Subscriptions</h5>
              <p>
                Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis (“
                <strong>Subscription(s)</strong>”). You will be billed in
                advance on a recurring and periodic basis (“
                <strong>Billing Cycle</strong>”). Billing cycles are set either
                on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of
                subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will
                automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you
                cancel it or Tulix cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription
                renewal either through your online account management page or by
                contacting Tulix customer support team.
              </p>
              <p>
                A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to
                process the payment for your subscription. You shall provide
                Tulix with accurate and complete billing information including
                full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a
                valid payment method information. By submitting such payment
                information, you automatically authorize Tulix to charge all
                Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such
                payment instruments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Tulix
                will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must
                proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full
                payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the
                invoice.
              </p>
              <h5>7.Fee Changes</h5>
              <p>
                Tulix, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify fees.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tulix will however provide you with reasonable prior notice of
                any change in fees before such change becomes effective.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your continued use of Service after fee change comes into effect
                constitutes your agreement to pay the modified fee amount.
              </p>
              <h5>8.Refunds</h5>
              <p>Except when required by law, paid fees are non-refundable.</p>
              <h5>9.Reliance by Tulix</h5>
              <p>
                Use care when inputting Beneficiary and Merchants details. When
                inputting Beneficiaries, ensure that their names are spelt
                correctly and provide in full, and verify that you have provided
                us with the Beneficiary’s correct phone number. For Merchants,
                ensure that you have input the correct Till or Paybill Number.
                You represent and warrant to us that all information you enter
                into the Application or otherwise provide to Tulix is true and
                complete, including information about you, your Payment Account,
                and your Beneficiary. You acknowledge that any errors in the
                information you provide, including misidentification of
                Beneficiary(s), incorrect or inconsistent Till and Paybill
                numbers, or misspellings, are your responsibility.
              </p>
              <h5>10.Error Resolution and Refunds</h5>
              <p>
                For error resolution, transaction cancellation, questions or
                complaints, contact us at{" "}
                <a href="mailto:hello@tulix.app">hello@tulix.app</a>{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                Any errors made when crediting funds to your personal wallet or
                to a beneficiary’s wallet can be rectified (including all fees,
                if any) within three (3) business days provided funds have not
                been utilized. In the case of making payments to merchants
                located in Kenya, given the fact that Tulix forwards funds
                immediately to user specified merchants, your payment is
                typically not cancellable or refundable. If you believe that you
                have made a payment in error, you must contact us within thirty
                (30) minutes after you initiated it at{" "}
                <a href="mailto:hello@tulix.app">hello@tulix.app</a>, and we
                will attempt to contact the merchant and recover the funds.
              </p>
              <p>
                The App allows for reversals of all amounts allocated due to
                account number, telephone number, Beneficiary name or other
                information incorrectly input, provided that the amount has not
                yet been utilized. You may be unable to perform a reversal if
                your allocation has already been utilized to make a payment out
                to a merchant in accordance with the information you provided.
              </p>
              <p>
                You have a right to dispute errors in your transaction that you
                believe to be the fault of Tulix. There is no charge for this
                service. If you believe there is an error, contact us at{" "}
                <a href="mailto:hello@tulix.app">hello@tulix.app</a> within 30
                days after the error has occurred, and provide your name,
                contact information, the Beneficiary's name, the Merchant
                payment details (where applicable), the date of your transfer,
                as well as the reason you believe there has been an error. Tulix
                will investigate and determine whether an error occurred, and we
                will complete the investigation within 60 days. We will inform
                you of the results of the investigation within three (3)
                business days after the investigation is completed. If Tulix was
                at fault, we will refund the total amount you paid, including
                fees, if any, within one business day, or as soon as reasonably
                practicable.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tulix will pay all refunds (whether resulting from a cancelled
                or disputed payment or allocation) by a credit to your Wallet.
                Alternatively, you can choose to have Tulix process the
                allocation or payment again for no additional charge. Except for
                our obligation to investigate and refund described above, Tulix
                is not liable to you for any loss resulting from Tulix’s
                inability to cancel or refund a payment.
